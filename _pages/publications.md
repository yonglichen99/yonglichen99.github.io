* [Long-Run Impacts of Public Investments in Children's Nutrition on Education: Evidence from Rural China](http://yonglichen99.github.io/files/free_lunch_latest.pdf) (Job Market Paper)
  
  Abstract: There have been many discussions about the effects of school meal programs in the literature. But these programs' long-term impacts on educational attainment and intergenerational mobility in education, especially for developing countries, are still under-investigated. To fill this gap, this paper explores a nutrition improvements program implemented in rural China using China Family Panel Study data and a Difference-in-Differences strategy. The results show that this policy improved educational attainment for rural students: One additional year of policy exposure led to a 0.14-year increase in schooling, a 9.3 percent increase in compulsory education completion, and a 37 percent decrease in illiteracy rate. Girls and students from poverty-stricken counties and low-income families, benefited more. The improvements in educational attainment were mainly driven by better health status, fewer absence days, a lower likelihood of absence for illness, and better academic performance. Further analyses show that this policy also promoted intergenerational mobility in education in rural China, and this effect was more pronounced for aforementioned socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. The findings suggest that increasing public investments in children's nutrition in less developed areas can be an effective way to reduce educational inequality and improve intergenerational mobility in education. 

* [The Unintended Impact of Fiscal Hierarchy Reforms on Local Air Quality: Evidence from China](http://yonglichen99.github.io/files/PMC0815.pdf)
  
  Abstract: This paper explores the causal relationship between the flattening of a fiscal hierarchy and environmental consequences using the Province-Managing-County (PMC) reform in China as a natural experiment. The reform enabled county governments to directly connect with provincial governments in fiscal affairs, bypassing the intermediary prefecture-level governments. Using a county-level panel data set from 2000 to 2012 and a Difference-in-Differences design, I find that local air quality measured by PM2.5 concentration was negatively affected by the PMC reform. Further analysis suggests that the deterioration in local air quality was not caused by better economic performance, since reformed counties’ GDP per capita also witnessed a significant drop compared with non-reformed counties. These impacts of the PMC reform were more negative for counties in provinces with larger number of subordinate governments under direct supervision before the reform. Mechanism analysis shows that reformed counties spent less on environmental protection, which could weaken environmental monitoring and enforcement, so firms in reformed counties generated more air pollutants. The findings of this paper imply that flattening a fiscal hierarchy may lead to undesirable outcomes if the monitoring from the upper-level government becomes less effective due to the increased number of subordinates.
