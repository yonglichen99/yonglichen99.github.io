* Long-Run Impacts of Public Investments in Children's Nutrition on Education: Evidence from Rural China (Job Market Paper)

  Abstract: The long-term impacts of school meal programs on educational attainment and intergenerational mobility in education are under-investigated, particularly for developing countries. To fill this gap, this paper explores a nutrition improvement program implemented in rural China. Using the China Family Panel Study data and a Difference-in-Differences identification strategy, my results show that the policy improved educational attainment for rural students: one additional year of policy exposure led to a 0.14-year increase in schooling, a 2.3 percentage point increase in middle school graduation, and a 1 percentage point decrease in illiteracy rate. Girls and students from poverty-stricken counties and low-income families benefited most. The improvements in educational attainment were associated with better health status, fewer absence days, a lower likelihood of absence for illness, and better academic performance. Further analysis shows that this policy also promoted intergenerational mobility in education in rural China, and this effect was more pronounced for aforementioned socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. 

* The Unintended Impact of Fiscal Hierarchy Reforms on Local Air Quality: Evidence from China
  
  Abstract: This paper explores the causal relationship between the flattening of a fiscal hierarchy and environmental consequences using the Province-Managing-County (PMC) reform in China as a quasi-experiment. The reform enabled county governments to directly connect with provincial governments in fiscal affairs, bypassing the intermediary prefecture-level governments. Using a county-level panel data set from 2000 to 2012 and a Difference-in-Differences design, I find that local air quality measured by PM2.5 concentration was negatively affected by the PMC reform. Further analysis suggests that the deterioration in local air quality was not caused by better economic performance, since reformed counties’ GDP per capita also witnessed a significant drop compared with non-reformed counties. These impacts of the PMC reform were more negative for counties in provinces with larger number of subordinate governments under direct supervision before the reform. Mechanism analysis shows that reformed counties spent less on environmental protection, which could weaken environmental monitoring and enforcement, so firms in reformed counties generated more air pollutants. The findings of this paper imply that flattening a fiscal hierarchy may lead to undesirable outcomes if the monitoring from the upper-level government becomes less effective due to the increased number of subordinates.
