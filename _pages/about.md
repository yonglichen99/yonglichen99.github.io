Welcome to my personal website! I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the [University of California, Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu/). I obtained my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Economics from [Nankai University](https://en.nankai.edu.cn/), China. I am on the job market for the 2022-2023 academic year.

My research interest mainly lies in the intersection of public economics and labor economics, with a regional focus on China. My research aims at understanding how public policies and institutions affect people’s welfare and a series of socioeconomic outcomes.
