## Abstract

This paper explores the causal relationship between the flattening of a fiscal hierarchy and environmental consequences using the Province-Managing-County (PMC) reform in China as a natural experiment. The reform enabled county governments to directly connect with provincial governments in fiscal affairs, bypassing the intermediary prefecture-level governments. Using a county-level panel data set from 2000 to 2012 and a Difference-in-Differences design, I find that local air quality measured by PM2.5 concentration was negatively affected by the PMC reform. Further analysis suggests that the deterioration in local air quality was not caused by better economic performance, since reformed countiesâ€™ GDP per capita also witnessed a significant drop compared with non-reformed counties. These impacts of the PMC reform were more negative for counties in provinces with larger number of subordinate governments under direct supervision before the reform. Mechanism analysis shows that reformed counties spent less on environmental protection, which could weaken environmental monitoring and enforcement, so firms in reformed counties generated more air pollutants. The findings of this paper imply that flattening a fiscal hierarchy may lead to undesirable outcomes if the monitoring from the upper-level government becomes less effective due to the increased number of subordinates.
